NAME

show - show all characters in a file

SYNOPSIS
.br
show [files ...]
.fi
.sp
.ti -3
DESCRIPTION
.br
Show copies the named files to the standard output,
replacing control characters by "^c", where c is the ascii
character used to enter the control character when
depressing the "control" key on most terminals.
More precisely, c is the ascii character whose
value is 100 (octal) plus the value of the control
character.
.sp
Control characters are those ascii characters with
values between 0 and 31, inclusive.  Newline characters
are displayed as usual, however.
.sp
If no filenames are given, or the name '-' is specified,
show will read from the standard input.
