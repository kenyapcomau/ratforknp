DESCRIPTION

Sort sorts lines of all the named files together and writes the result
on the standard output.
If no files are given or the filename '-' appears, standard input
is read.

The sort key is an entire line.
Default ordering is alphabetic by characters as they are represented
in ASCII format.
The ordering is affected by the
following flags, one or more of which may appear.

BUGS
.br
The merge phase is performed with a polyphase merge/sort algorithm,
which requires an end-of-run delimiter on the scratch files.
The one chosen is
a bare ^D (ASCII code 4) on a line.  If this is in conflict with your
data files, the symbol CTRLD in the sort symbol definitions
should be redefined.
