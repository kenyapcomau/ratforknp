SYNOPSIS
.br
xref [-f] [files ...]
.fi
.sp

DESCRIPTION
.br
Xref
produces a cross-reference
list of the symbols in each of the named files
on the standard output.
Each symbol is listed followed by the numbers of the lines
in which it appears.
If no files are given,
or the file "-" is specified, xref reads the standard input.
.sp
A symbol is defined as a string of letters, digits, underlines,
or periods that begins with a letter.
Symbols exceeding an internal limit are truncated.
This limit is determined by the MAXTOK definition in
the source code, and is currently set to 15.
.sp
Normally, xref treats upper- and lower-case letters as different
characters.  The -f option causes all letters to be folded to
lower-case.

in the source code.

BUGS/DEFICIENCIES
