SYNOPSIS
.br
.in 7
comm
[-123] file1 file2
.sp 1

DESCRIPTION
.br
.in 7
Comm
reads
file1
and
file2,
which should be sorted, and produces a three column output:
lines only in
file1,
lines only in
file2,
and lines in both files.
The filename '-' means the standard input.
If there is only one file argument,
file2
refers to the standard input.

The optional arguments -1, -2, and -3 specify the printing of
only the corresponding column.
Thus
comm -3
prints only the lines common to both files, and
comm -12
prints lines which are in either file, but not in both.
The default is -123.

BUGS
.br
.in 7
The flags used by this tool are the reverse of those used by the
Unix 'comm'.  In Unix, the flags 1, 2, and 3
.bd
suppress
printing of the corresponding column.
Kernighan, on page 126 of 'Software Tools' suggests the
version used above.
