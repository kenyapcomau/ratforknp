DESCRIPTION

Wc prints the number of lines, words, and characters in the named
files.
The filename "-" specifies the standard input.
A total is also printed.  A "word" is any sequence of characters
delimited by white space.
.sp
The options -l, -w, and -c specify, respectively, that only the line,
word, or character count be printed.  For example,
.sp
.in +3
.nf
wc -lc foo
.in -3
.sp
.fi
prints the number of lines and characters in "foo".

If no files are given, wc reads its standard input and the total
count is suppressed.
