Runoff
formats text according to control lines embedded
in the text in the given file.
Input consists of intermixed
"text lines,"
which contain information to be formatted, and
"request lines,"
which contain instructions about how to format
it.
Request lines begin with a distinguished
"control character,"
normally a period.
.s3
Output lines may be
filled
as nearly as possible with words without regard to
input lineation.
Line
breaks
may be caused at specified places by
certain commands.
.s3
The capabilities of
runoff
are specified in the attached request summary.
Numerical values are denoted there by n or +n,
titles by t, and single characters by c.
Numbers denoted +n may be signed + or -,
in which case they signify relative changes to
a quantity, otherwise they signify
an absolute resetting.
Missing n fields are ordinarily taken to be 1,
missing t fields to be empty, and c fields to shut off
the appropriate special interpretation.
.s3
Running titles usually appear at top and bottom of every
page.
they are set by requests like
.sp
.in +10
 .he 'Part1'Part2'Part3'
.in -10
.s3
Part1 is left justified, Part2 is centered,
and Part3 is right justified on the page.
Any % sign in a title is replaced by the current
page number.
Any nonblank may serve as a quote.
